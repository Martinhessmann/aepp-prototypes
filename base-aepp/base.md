To protect the main account and to be able to recover it from a different device a PIN needs to be set.

## 💳  Manage identities
With the account creation a public ID is automatically created.  A public ID is an address derived from an extended private key. As long as there is only one ID, a hint is shown that a new ID can be created.

Multiple derived public IDs can be created – each with a own unique address and an own token balance. Only one can be active at a time – the grey card indicates an inactive ID.
