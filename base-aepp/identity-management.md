# Manage Identities

One user can have multiple Identities, every identitiy has a balance. An æepp with access to a specific identitiy has full control of the balance and can work with æternity-tokens of this identitiy. A user can connect multiple æpps with one identitiy.



Identities can be private or public as explained in the [onboarding](onboarding.md) and are represented as cards.



## Dashboard

## Revoke authorization
As a user with a lot of different identities, one might lose track of which æpp has access to which identity. In this case a user might search for a specific æpp to review transactions and revoke authorization. We created the authorized æpps section for this case.
