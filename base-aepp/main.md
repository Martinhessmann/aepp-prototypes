# Base æpp

The Base aepp will be the first touchpoint with the aeternity block chain for many new users. Either accessing it directly or because they want to use an 
æpp that requires authorization from the base æpp.

Users will be able to administrate their identities, funds and access of applications to identities. In the æternity ecosystem the base æpp functions as a identity manager.

The Base app will be native app. Other apps can communicate with the base æpp to authorize. 

Users can have have multiple identities in the base æpp. Each identity has a balance of AET (æternity tokens) and can have a profile and a name.

One identity can either be public or private. Private identities make it hard to trace transactions to a person. Public identities are connected to a name and all transactions are publicly visible.

All described concepts are in a very early prototype stage and subject to change/discussion. Please use the issue board if you have ideas for improvement.
