# Onboarding

Our goal is to provide access to the aeternity block chain with ease. Providing all necessary information for users who are unfamiliar with block chain concepts on one Hand. On the other Hand we want experts to be able to jump right into identity creation.
We created a conversational interface to implement this freedom of choice.

The onboarding starts, a private identity is pre-made for the user. The user sees it in the upper area of the screen. The lower area is a conversational interface. The first message from the app is that the card is made and that it’s private. The user is asked if he wants to leave it private, make it public, or leave everything and instantly go further and start using the app. Also a button is added for more information.
