# æpp-prototypes
Welcome to Æpp Prototypes! Here we design concepts and develop prototypes of æpps that will run on the æterenity blockchain.

Our æpps are designed mobile first, wich means, that all functionality should work within the 375*667px artboard.


## Contributing
If you want to contribute, you have two options:

1. Use the Mac App and the Sketch Plugin [Kactus](https://github.com/kactus-io/kactus), make a branch, keep track of changes and create pull requests of this repository.

or

2. Create a new Sketch File, but use our Symbols as a Styleguide using the Sketch Library function. [Learn more about libraries](https://www.sketchapp.com/docs/libraries/adding-libraries)


### Dependencies
These Sketch Plugins are required to handle the sketch file.
* [Anima App](https://animaapp.github.io/)
* [Symbol Organizer](https://github.com/sonburn/symbol-organizer)


## Æpps

### Base æpp & Identity manager
First touchpoint with the aeternity blockchain. Account creation, login, Identity manager and Æpp browser

The user can create one main account and several identities. Each identity will be a proper wallet.
The user can switch between identities to authorize an æpp to do transactions on the blockchain/pay tokens for activities.

* [Sprint 01 – Initial designs](base-aepp/onboarding.md)
* [Sprint 01 – Initial designs](base-aepp/identity-management.md)

### Notary
A conversional interface to create hashes of files and store them on the æternity blockchain, as a undeniable proof a file existed at a certain time in the past.

The user can decide if the file itself also should be saved on an indelible server.

### Message Wall
Write messages into the æternal blockchain space, to share thoughts for now and forever.
Read æternal messages because you’re interested in the æternity community.
Express support for messages that you like.

1. Show messages
2. Write a message
3. Like a message with an ERC20 AE-Token, this token shall be transferred to message author
