# æpp-prototypes
Welcome to Æpp Prototypes! Here we design concepts and develop prototypes of æpps that will run on the æterenity blockchain.

Our æpps are designed mobile first, wich means, that all functionality should work within the 375*667px artboard.

2. Create a new Sketch File, but use our Symbols as a Styleguide using the Sketch Library function. [Learn more about libraries](https://www.sketchapp.com/docs/libraries/adding-libraries)


### Dependencies
These Sketch Plugins are required to open the sketch file.
* [Anima App](https://animaapp.github.io/)


## Æpps

### Base æpp & Identity manager
First touchpoint with the aeternity blockchain. Account creation, login, Identity manager and Æpp browser

The user can create one main account and several identities. Each identity will be a proper wallet.
The user can switch between identities to authorize an æpp to do transactions on the blockchain/pay tokens for activities.

* [Sprint 02 – Latest update](base-aepp/sprint_02.md)

* [Sprint 01 – Initial designs](base-aepp/main.md)


### Notary
A conversional interface to create hashes of files and store them on the æternity blockchain, as a undeniable proof a file existed at a certain time in the past.

* The user can decide if the file itself also should be saved on an indelible server.
